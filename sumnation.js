    Description of Program

    This program is a library of functions that allows the user sum a series of numbers of their choosing. Wrapper functions are also 
    written out allowing the user to ignore features of the general sumnation procedure that they don't need. This program is written 
    in a functional style in order to the express the concept of sumnation concisely, it is not optimised to perform the calculation 
    quickly.
    
    The power of the function sumnation is expressed by calculating four constants and two other self-explanatory results that 
    can be approximated by calculating a series of numbers correct to three decimal places.

    The constants are:
        1. An approximate solution to the Basel Problem. 
            The Basel problem involves finding the precise value of the sum of the sequence 1 / (n ^ 2) where n starts at 1
        and continues to infinity. In others the Basel problem wants to find the sum of the sequence 
        1 + 1/2 + 1/9 + 1/16 + 1/25 + .... Euler proved that the precise value is equal to (pi ^ 2) / 6. We can express
        the Basel problem in terms of the Riemann Zeta function. The Basel Problem is the solution to ùúÅ(2). 

        The Riemann Zeta Function asserts

            ùúÅ(s) = (for n from 1 to infinity) SUM [1 / (n ^ s)]

            or,
            
            ùúÅ(s) = 1 + 1 / (2 ^ s) + 1 / (3 ^ s) + ...

            where,
                s is equal to real part of a given complex number, z. 

        2. The probability that two randomly selected numbers, a and b, are coprime. The probability is the reciprocal of
        the answer to the Basel Problem. Two numbers are coprime if the highest number that can divide both of them is 1. 
        In other words, gcd(a, b) = 1.  

        2. Ap√©ry's Constant - The mathematician Roger Ap√©ry proved that ùúÅ(3) is an irrational number, which is Ap√©ry's constant. 

        3. Euler-Mascheroni Constant - The constant is calculated via the following:

            Œ≥ = (for m from 2 to infinity) SUM [(-1)^m * (ùúÅ(m) / m)]

        4. Pi - We calculate pi using our solution to the Basel problem.
